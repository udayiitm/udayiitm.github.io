## Projects


  
  **An e-commerce site**\
     As a college project I made an e-commerce site program in which users can see the list of items available and just by entering the incex of their item they can add it into
      their cart. At the time of checkout they can enter applicable coupon for discount.
      
   You can check it in my github repo as [ecommerce](https://github.com/udayiitm/ecommerce)
      
      
  
   **Computer Vision**\
  An image processing project which helps the airplane pilots to have better view. Pilots often face visibility problems at the time of landing due to clouds.Using image processing I eliminated the pixel values corresponding to the clouds So, that images get more clearer and pilots get better view.
