# udayiitm.github.io

This hackthon gave a great opportunity in exploring Github and building my own first ever websiteðŸ˜€. 
I really enjoyed participating in this. I am new to Github and to this programming. I started my programming journey exactly an year ago.
Now I very proud that I was able to build my own site. 
Being a beginner in programming I am not having much content to show on my portfolio but later I understood making this portfolio website itself a content that I can keep in my future.
A great hands on experienceðŸ˜ƒ
A big thank to dev days team and looking forward for more sessions like this.
